/**
 * Jumping on the clouds
 * This problem is very simple but I thought it
 * was kind of cool. We need to realize that we obviously
 * start at the beginning of the array and we want to be greedy
 * in that we want to make the most ground with the least number
 * of steps as possible. The question is can we get in any trouble
 * by being greedy? In other words, is it possible that taking two
 * steps when both one and two-steps are available will lead to harm?
 * The answer is no. If at all you take two steps instead of one and run
 * into a dead end, it is not possible to have previously taken any combination
 * of one-steps and avoid the dead end. So we always want to take two steps when
 * we can. This can be proved through contradiction:
 *
 * 0 0 0 1 1
 * Starting at the beginning, we want to take two steps. We quickly realize we
 * are stuck and therefore can never reach the end. Since the problem statement
 * says there is always a solution to every given set this must mean we can get
 * to the end by making our first step a single step instead of a two-step. So we
 * try that and realize that any combination of single steps can never put us in a
 * position that can solve the problem, and therefore we have a contradiction. Through
 * this contradiction we see that you cannot reach some position through some combination
 * of two steps that is impossible to reach with some combination of one-steps. Of course
 * it is possible to reach some position through some combination of one-steps that is impossible
 * to reach with two-steps. But does this help at all?
 * Consider the following:
 *
 * 0 0 1 0
 * In this case our first step can only be a one-step because a two-step is not available. The next
 * step can only be a two-step because a one-step is not available. This shows that a one-step is only
 * beneficial if a two-step simply is not available. So what if both are available?
 *
 * 0 0 0 1 0
 * In this case our first step can either be a one or a two-step. It is obvious our last step will have to
 * be a two-step, however we can get to that point quicker by taking a two-step instead of a one, when both
 * are available. This goes back to our original point, and shows that taking a two-step when both are available
 * can never hurt us, but only speed us up! It makes sense, since all positions obtained via a two-step will always
 * be trampled across by a one-step at some point. Since this is a pretty simple problem, I'll stop writing now.
