/**
 * Happy Ladybugs
 * This is a rather simple problem but I enjoyed it.
 * The description can be found in the above source link.
 * This algorithm exibits a common pattern found in ones alike
 * in that it will give you some problem, present to you the solution
 * in the form of a long process that must be gone through, and then only
 * ask you to output some boolean, or maybe the number of times some condition
 * was met. Often, when this is the only required information you can likely get
 * around actually computing the guts of the obvious algorithm but just finding what
 * some condition in the input data that correlates to the output you need.
 *
 * In this case we need to decide if some string of characters is essentially "happy".
 * The definition of "happy" can be found in the problem description but basically we need
 * to look at the input. Either we are given a happy string, or a not-happy string. If the string
 * representing the board is not happy then we need to decide whether it can be made happy or not.
 * In this case any board string can be happy if the number of each type of character > 1 and there
 * is at least ONE empty space in it to move bugs around on the board. If this condition is met then
 * the board can be made happy and we output "YES". We can do this easily by storing the number of times
 * each character appears, and storing some boolean to correspond whether or not there is a space in the
 * string. Note that we can be given an input string which contains no spaces at all, but is happy. In this
 * case our algorithm would return indicate that the string is happy since there are no spaces, so what we first
 * need to do is see if the given string is happy to begin with. Then if it is not, we move onto seeing if it can
 * be made happy, with our aforementioned conditions.
 *
 * Complexity analysis:
 * Time complexity: O(n)
 * Space complexity: O(1)

/**
 * This function is used to determine whether
 * or not some input string is already happy. It
 * is a bit messy, but basically what we need to do
 * is start at some character, and if it has at least
 * one identical neighbor, we need to find either:
 *   1.) The next character that is not the same color
 *   2.) The next character after some space (whether its the same color as the previous one or not)
 * If each found character has at least one identical neighbor then the string is happy.
